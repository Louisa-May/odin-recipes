    <p>Creamy Risotto</p>
    <br />
    <p>
      Risotto is a creamy Italian dish that tastes a lot like the rice version
      of mac and cheese. Unlike other rice recipes that require simmering in a
      pot of water, risotto is cooked very slowly by adding small amounts of
      liquid at a time. This process allows the rice to release its starches,
      creating a rich, velvety sauce with soft but slightly al dente grains.

    <p>Ingredients</p>
    <ul>
      1.1 litres organic stock , such as chicken, fish, vegetable
    </ul>
    <ul>
      1 large onion
    </ul>
    <ul>
      2 cloves of garlic
    </ul>
    <ul>
      ½ a head of celery
    </ul>
    <ul>
      90 g Parmesan cheese
    </ul>
    <ul>
      2 tablespoons olive oil
    </ul>
    <ul>
      unsalted butter
    </ul>
    <ul>
      400 g risotto rice
    </ul>
    <ul>
      2 wine glasses of dry white wine
    </ul>
    <p>Steps</p>
    <ol>
      Heat the stock. Peel and finely chop the onion and garlic, trim and finely
      chop the celery. Finely grate the Parmesan.
    </ol>
    <ol>
      In a separate pan, heat the oil and 1 small knob of butter over a low
      heat, add the onions, garlic and celery, and fry gently for about 15
      minutes, or until softened but not coloured.
    </ol>
    <ol>
      Add the rice and turn up the heat – the rice will now begin to lightly
      fry, so keep stirring it. After 1 minute it will look slightly
      translucent. Add the wine and keep stirring — it will smell fantastic. Any
      harsh alcohol flavours will evaporate and leave the rice with a tasty
      essence.
    </ol>
    <ol>
      Once the wine has cooked into the rice, add your first ladle of hot stock
      and a good pinch of sea salt. Turn the heat down to a simmer so the rice
      doesn’t cook too quickly on the outside.
    </ol>
    <ol>
      Keep adding ladlefuls of stock, stirring and almost massaging the creamy
      starch out of the rice, allowing each ladleful to be absorbed before
      adding the next. This will take around 15 minutes. Taste the rice — is it
      cooked? Carry on adding stock until the rice is soft but with a slight
      bite. Don’t forget to check the seasoning carefully. If you run out of
      stock before the rice is cooked, add some boiling water.
    </ol>
    <ol>
      Remove the pan from the heat, add 1 knob of butter and the Parmesan, then
      stir well.
    </ol>
    <ol>
      Place a lid on the pan and allow to sit for 2 minutes – this is the most
      important part of making the perfect risotto, as this is when it becomes
      outrageously creamy and oozy like it should be. Eat it as soon as
      possible, while the risotto retains its beautiful texture.
    </ol>
