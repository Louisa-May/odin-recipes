      Spaghetti bolognese consists of spaghetti (long strings of pasta) with an
      Italian ragù (meat sauce) made with minced beef, bacon and tomatoes,
      served with Parmesan cheese. Spaghetti bolognese is one of the most
      popular pasta dishes eaten outside of Italy.

    <p>Steps</p>
    <ol>
      Put a large saucepan on a medium heat and add 1 tbsp olive oil.
    </ol>
    <ol>
      Add 4 finely chopped bacon rashers and fry for 10 mins until golden and
      crisp.
    </ol>
    <ol>
      Reduce the heat and add the 2 onions, 2 carrots, 2 celery sticks, 2 garlic
      cloves and the leaves from 2-3 sprigs rosemary, all finely chopped, then
      fry for 10 mins. Stir the veg often until it softens
    </ol>
    <ol>
      Increase the heat to medium-high, add 500g beef mince and cook stirring
      for 3-4 mins until the meat is browned all over.
    </ol>
    <ol>
      Add 2 tins plum tomatoes, the finely chopped leaves from ¾ small pack
      basil, 1 tsp dried oregano, 2 bay leaves, 2 tbsp tomato purée, 1 beef
      stock cube, 1 deseeded and finely chopped red chilli (if using), 125ml red
      wine and 6 halved cherry tomatoes. Stir with a wooden spoon, breaking up
      the plum tomatoes.
    </ol>
    <ol>
      Bring to the boil, reduce to a gentle simmer and cover with a lid. Cook
      for 1 hr 15 mins stirring occasionally, until you have a rich, thick
      sauce.
    </ol>
    <ol>
      Add the 75g grated parmesan, check the seasoning and stir.
    </ol>
    <ol>
      When the bolognese is nearly finished, cook 400g spaghetti following the
      pack instructions.
    </ol>
    <ol>
      Drain the spaghetti and either stir into the bolognese sauce, or serve the
      sauce on top. Serve with more grated parmesan, the remaining basil leaves
      and crusty bread, if you like.
